# Airline routes project written in React :airplane:

This project uses React to display international airline routes. A hosted version can be found on [Heroku](https://airline-routes-et.herokuapp.com/).

The current version uses a list of routes and displays relevant data based on user interactions, like applying filters and clicking on routes displayed on the map.
